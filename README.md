## Gaussian Correlation Inequality — TER 

This repository contains my Academic Research Project (TER) on the **Gaussian Correlation Inequality (GCI)**.
It includes:
- an introduction to Gaussian vectors,
- a geometric reduction,
- a Laplace-transform approach,
- and a streamlined presentation of Royen’s proof.
